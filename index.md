  Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at Virginia Commonwealth University majoring in Biomedical Engineering. My general research interests include assistive and healthcare robotics, as well as human-robot interaction. I currently have the great pleasure of exploring these interests as a member of the Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) lab, led by Dr. Zackory Erickson, at Carnegie Mellon University. I am applying to PhD programs in Robotics for admission in Fall 2022.

## News
**2/1/22**: The [Bodies Uncovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04930) paper has been accepted for presentation at ICRA 2022 and for inclusion in the conference Proceedings! I can't wait to share my work in Philadelphia in May!

**12/19/21:** My paper, ["Bodies Uncovered: Learning to Manipulate Real Blankets Around People via Physics Simulations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04930), has been accepted for publication in RA-L! The paper has also been forwarded to ICRA for consideration in the conference proceedings.

**11/10/21:** The work I did as part of the SURE Robotics REU was featured on the Georgia Tech Research news site! The interview can be found [here](https://research.gatech.edu/lego-league-georgia-tech-healthcare-robotics-lab).

**10/11/21:** I am joining the [Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) lab](https://rchi-lab.github.io/), led by [Dr. Zackory Erickson](https://zackory.com/), at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University! I will be working remotely to continue my previous research into robotic bedding manipulation around people.

**9/9/21:** I submitted my first-ever paper as first author, based on my summer work as part of the SURE Robotics REU, for review! We submitted the paper for consideration in RA-L and, by extension, ICRA. The preprint version the paper is available at [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04930).

**Summer 2021:** I particated in the SURE Robotics REU at Georgia Tech this summer! I investigated autonomous robotic bedding manipulation around people under the guidance of [Dr. Zackory Erickson](https://zackory.com/) and [Dr. Charlie Kemp](https://charliekemp.com/).
